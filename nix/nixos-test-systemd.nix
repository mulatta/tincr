# Exercises the systemd integration surface that contrib/tincd@.service
# and contrib/tincd@.socket encode: Type=notify, WatchdogSec, ExecReload,
# and TCP socket activation via LISTEN_FDS. The other VM tests run under
# the upstream services.tinc module (Type=simple, no .socket); this one
# wires the units by hand so a regression in sd_notify, the event-loop
# watchdog timer, or adopt_listeners is caught.
#
# The contrib units themselves hard-code FHS paths and can't run on
# NixOS verbatim, so they are checked with `systemd-analyze verify` and
# the live units below mirror their semantics 1:1.
